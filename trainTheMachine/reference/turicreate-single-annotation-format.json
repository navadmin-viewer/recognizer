//The ground truth annotations for the image above should be encoded as a list of dictionaries,

//optional 'type': 'rectangle' 
//You may optionally include 'type': 'rectangle' to explicitly denote these as bounding boxes. 
//If type is defined as something else, the object detector will ignore that dictionary. 
//A bounding box is defined by four values (x, y, width, height) where (0, 0) is the top left corner. 
//The center of the box is located at (x, y):
